<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home. People who splice wires by twisting the ends together and covering the result with electrical tape face a higher risk of encountering a problem in the future.</p>

Many of the newer modeled homes come with these fancy lighting systems already in place but if you live in an older home you do not have you deal with the outdated dull lighting that is currently in place.</p>
