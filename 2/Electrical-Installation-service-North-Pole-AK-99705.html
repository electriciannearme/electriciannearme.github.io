Graduates of electrical engineering tech programs may choose to go in a direction other than an apprenticeship, such as working to create electrical designs of buildings and electronic devices alongside engineers and architects. Have a licensed electrician review your home's electrical system every ten years.</p>
<p>In the case of lightning, a power surge coming in through your power lines can overheat your equipment. A burning candle left unattended or grease splattering across a hot burner on the stove are obvious fire dangers, but another major contributor to household fires is electricity.
