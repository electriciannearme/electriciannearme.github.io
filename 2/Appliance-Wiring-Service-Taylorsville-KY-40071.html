<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring. If there are two brass screws for the black wire, and a breakable tab between them, it might be possible. Your final step is to turn on the transformer to ensure that the lights work. If you are the type to use many electronics in your home then you are aware of the energy needed to run all that equipment and the inconvenience of having to unplug all of them when they are not being used.</p>
<p>Your electrical contractor will have honed their skills over the years working on a broad range of jobs.

If you have old, outdated wiring, there is a higher possibility of electrical fire. This will expose the surrounding areas and the cables themselves to high temperatures, from which an electrical fire can start. Learn safety tips from our friend, Louie the Lightning Bug, and find videos, games and more to teach children how to stay safe around electricity.</p>
<p>You should also consider the wattage of the fixtures to stay within the capacity of the transformer. When planning lighting to go around seating areas keep the deck light fixtures relatively low. Decorative fixtures will be placed in plain sight; otherwise, conceal the light source when possible.
