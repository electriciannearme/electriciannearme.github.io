<p>An electrical panel (or breaker box) is the source of your home's electrical system. And power outages can threaten the very lives of those who depend on electrically powered medical equipment to stay alive and well. For example, if a circuit breaker repeatedly trips after being reset, electricians determine the reason and fix it. If there is voltage, and the switch is operating properly check the water pump wiring for an inline fuse. Important Note: We can only perform service and maintenance on generators that we install. Pull the outlet and wires out from the wall enough that you have space to work.</p>
<p>It also contains circuit breakers that detect dangerous power surges and cut the circuit's power to reduce the risks of damage and fires. They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas lines—that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators. Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>
