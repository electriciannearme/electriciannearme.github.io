Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency. If electric fault causes too much damage, the replacement of electrical wiring is necessary. As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>
<p>This course covers the basic electrical quantities of current, voltage, and capacitance that are universal to all circuits. Our licensed, certified and insured electricians are always available to help restore the safety and reliability of your electrical system. You can use your portable generator to power up your most vital appliances when your home loses electricity, for your home DIY projects, or even during a backyard BBQ. Some whole house generators come with a mounting pad or need a cement block to be placed upon.</p>

Water and electricity can be lethal so it is more important to maintain electrical safety in the kitchen and bathroom.
