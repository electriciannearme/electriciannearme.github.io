Older homes, mostly homes built prior to 1970, are at risk for electrical fires. Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs. We make sure that your outdoor lighting system is good as new, by conducting frequent outdoor lighting inspections and repairs, and by making sure that fixtures and glass lenses are clean.</p>
<p>Remember to keep tall ladders, roofing materials and pruning equipment clear of overhead power lines to avoid a hazardous situation. Now that you have done the screws, the first step to installing your HID lights is to remove the battery's negative cable. Circuits become overloaded when there is too much demand placed on your home's electrical system. When deciding where to place lights, you need to assess the elements on your property such as trees, flower beds, statues and walkways.</p>
<p>To hardwire a low voltage transformer, the main power should be turned off at the breaker panel before making any electrical connections. Mark Donovan of shows how to wire a combo switch outlet circuit such that the outlet is constantly powered. We do this to aim all your fixtures for optimal lightshed and perform a final voltage check. Or, if the outlets are to also be half-hots, use a three conductor (plus ground) to install between the outlets and splice into both the hot line and the switched line.</p>
