Our NATE-certified technicians are trained to install portable and whole-home generators for any home in the area. Electrical Contractor License: According to the Board, municipalities can accept contracting business owners, their partners, chairman of the board or CEO that present the contracting business. Once you check that everything is working, bury the extra wire, secure the lights, and do any final adjustments to make sure everything looks good.</p>
<p>But most older breaker panels can't handle anywhere close to the sum of all your home circuits. Always tape extension cords to walls or floors when necessary. Pushmatic panels have weak breaker switches that get harder to reset over time. LIGHTING DESIGN Plan your lighting design by selecting features to enhance, and areas that need light. Thus, the owner is responsible for all issues related to the electric service panel.

Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to ground”. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>
<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur. It would be smart for the Licensed Electrician to take some Industrial Electrician courses too, but if time is of the essence, the electrician may want to get PLC Troubleshooting training first.
