I'm very impressed with the quality and innovation in the new AMP line of lighting fixtures. To do everything right, here are the basic steps on installing these lights at home.

<p>Dont use coiled extension cords. Along with the green ground terminal screw that is common to any switch type, the single-pole switch has two terminal screws. No list of tips on how to run a successful electrical business is complete without a reminder to ask your customers to refer their friends to you.

Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011.
