Take Your Surge Protector for a Spin by Grgegory Schmidt, The New York Times, January 30, 2013.

It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
