A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot. Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months. Electrical Contractors are not issued with a plastic licence card but are issued with a Certificate of Registration.</p>

Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
<p>TPC Trainco provides live training for maintenance personnel in industrial plants and large facilities. This should be handled professionally as it involves permits, building codes, and professional electrical, plumbing and potentially gas line work if your power source is natural gas. When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>
