<p>Replacement circuit breakers cost $15 - $25 and an electrician will charge $50 - $100 for labor. Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians. Either way, you will need what is called "3-wire cable" (black, red, white, and green OR metal all sheathed together: yes I know that makes 4 wires, but that's what it's called!) to connect the two boxes.</p>
