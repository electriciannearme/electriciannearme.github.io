Home generators are a backup power source for your home that will automatically turn on in seconds following any power outage or power service interruption, keeping the lights on, the water hot, the HVACⓇ or heat on, your electronics charged and operational, keeping your lines of communication open, and your home safe and secure for your family and your property.</p>

In outdoor settings use only outdoor approved temporary wiring and extension cords. Here at HedgeHog, we also provide commercial electrical emergency services.

<p>And since it's low voltage lighting, it's safe to use and install, even for beginners. A simple motor timer found in many homes is used to control the wash cycles of automatic washing machines. When you replace your old fuse box with a circuit breaker, you will create more space during the electrical panel installation. Because low voltage lighting wires only have to be a few inches deep, spring clean up can cause some problems. In the UK the ‘live' wire is coloured red, the ‘neutral' is coloured blue or black and the ‘earth' is coloured yellow with green stripes.</p>

<p>Attach the white to the unused terminal with the other white on the outlet and splice the ground to the ground going to the existing outlet, again with a short jumper so it can be re-attached back where it was. It is a problem that exists in over half of all American households - a wall switch in a room that turns on an outlet, but not the outlet that you want it to activate. From this unit electrical wiring or lines send power to your appliances, lights, and outlets.</p>
