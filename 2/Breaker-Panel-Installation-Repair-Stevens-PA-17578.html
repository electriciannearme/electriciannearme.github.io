<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights. But none of these lights can compare to the LED light bulb. Check electrical cords to make sure they are not running across doorways or under carpets where they are can get damaged. In the safe use of electricity in the home, circuit breakers should be used to terminate power to outlets.</p>
<p>The loose end of the 6" ground wire will terminate on the green ground screw of the outlet.

Decorative fixtures will be placed in plain sight; otherwise, conceal the light source when possible. After mending the problem, the electrician can also work out the source of the problem and evaluate your electrical panel wiring to determine what needs to be done to prevent similar circumstances in the future.</p>
