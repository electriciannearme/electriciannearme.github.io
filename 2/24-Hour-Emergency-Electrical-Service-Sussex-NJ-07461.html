Code § SPS 305.40 , the electrical wiring activities that may be undertaken by a person who holds a license or registration as a licensed Residential Master Electrician, a licensed Residential Journeyman Electrician or a registered Residential Electrical Apprentice shall be limited to wiring associated with dwellings, dwelling units and detached accessory buildings and structures serving the dwellings or the dwelling units, such as garages, carports, gazebos, and swimming pools.</p>
