<p>The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the operation and maintenance of large alternating current (AC) generators, which are primarily used to supply electrical power in the magnitude of kilowatts (thousands of watts) and megawatts (millions of watts). Master electricians are certified to act as an administrator to make sure an electrical contractor's work follows the electrical laws and rules. Although aluminum is more cost-effective, electricians warn homeowners that this type of wiring must be installed properly, otherwise it can increase the risk of house fires.</p>
