After removing the panel and all of the breakers, the electrician will check to ensure that all wiring is sound and grounded.</p>
<p>Interest in low voltage, or 12v, lighting has grown in our increasingly energy-conscious customers over the last several years, with the emergence and proliferation of long-life, energy-efficient lighting.
