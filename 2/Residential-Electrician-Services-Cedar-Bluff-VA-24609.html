Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

<p>The most important step is to map out your lighting system on paper before you start installing your low voltage system. When I tried to replace the first outlet, I found a section on the yellow and white cables each with a section that was stripped bare and might have been connected, not sure. And like water, electricity can placed under "pressure" in this case called "voltage". Our technicians can install a variety of portable generators, and we'll help you select the right one for you home, so give us a call today.</p>
<p>This may be hard to accept, but extension cords are designed for short-term use only.
