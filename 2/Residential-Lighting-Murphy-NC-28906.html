A home standby generator is a little bit more of a complex undertaking than just running a portable and using an extension cord and some surge protectors.</p>
<p>Breakers are more reliable and compliant with modern electrical codes, while also having the capacity to handle higher amperages. These features include things like automatic start, fuel gauge, alternative fuel capability, low-oil auto shut-off, noise reduction, transfer switch and wheels for mobility. Modern electrical outlets provide flexible, safe, and reliable power delivery. If a short or ground is detected, disconnect the field wiring circuit to the motor starter to determine if the problem is internal to the motor contactor overload circuit(s) or in the field control wiring.</p>
