Orient Fans, the erstwhile Calcutta Electrical Manufacturing Company, became a part of the CK Birla Group in 1954 and was subsequently rechristened Orient Electric in 2014. We are the emergency electrician company in Sydney that you can rely on. We are fully licensed, experienced and fully insured and knowledge.</p>

If your wall wire is composed of a group of smaller wires, use the pliers to gently twist the ends of the wires together to make them whole,” and then follow the same direction.</p>
<p>LED lighting can also help reduce energy usage as they are more energy efficient than traditional light bulbs. In order to improve production, meet the ever-changing needs of the customers, and establish itself as a global market leader, Orient Electric also equipped its manufacturing plants at Faridabad in Haryana and Kolkata in the state of West Bengal with state of the art machinery and technology.
