You would need to combine the four 20A branch circuits in an AC combiner panel, as Marvin mentioned, and then tap onto the feeders from the meter using Polaris taps or insulation piercings. Electrical Contractor License: Electrical contractors need to have a license issued by the State Contractors Board after passing an exam. Alternatively, you can wire the switch up in such a way that only that single outlet will be controlled by the switch, but other outlets in the circuit will still stay powered on constantly.</p>
