All of the power for your home comes through this panel from the utility company to the exit wires that split off and service different parts of the house. You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>Having an electrician replace or rebuild your present electrical service panel will prevent many problems in the future. Then go around the lights and bury the cable. Warren has an electrical background and has taught troubleshooting for several years at a prominent electrical utility.
