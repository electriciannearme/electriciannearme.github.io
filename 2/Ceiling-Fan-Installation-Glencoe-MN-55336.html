Also, if you need to T-splice your wire, we recommend using DBRY Gel Filled Connectors to keep the wires tight and in a waterproof tube. With booming infrastructure, new energy conservation projects, and an aging workforce, demand for skilled electricians is on the rise.</p>
<p>Many states require seven years of experience as an electrician or a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering for certification as a master electrician. It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>
