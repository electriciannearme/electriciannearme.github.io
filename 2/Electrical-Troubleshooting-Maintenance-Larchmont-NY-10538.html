<p>Installing new light fixtures involves a series of steps like turning off power to the applicable areas of your home, mounting the fixture, and ensuring that the wiring is properly connected.

Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
