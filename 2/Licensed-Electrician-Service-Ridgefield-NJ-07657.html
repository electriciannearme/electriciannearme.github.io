<p>Pulling on a cord can damage the appliance, the plug or the outlet. If you are planning a home lighting design project, you obviously want to leave the task to someone who knows what they are doing. A master electrician is not only permitted to work on his own, he is the one who can bid for jobs, pull permits, lay out wiring systems and installations.
