The increased cost of fuel oil and all precious metals has caused many manufacturers of electrical equipment to inventory less than ever before, and in some cases, major electrical items needed for emergency electrical services and repair such as power transformers and high voltage switchgear are made-to-order with lead times between 20 and 50 weeks.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire.
