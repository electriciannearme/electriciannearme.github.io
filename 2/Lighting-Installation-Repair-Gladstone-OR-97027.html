<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller. Connected to your LP or natural gas fuel supply, the backup generator kicks in within seconds of determining a power loss and can run as long as it takes for your utility power to turn back on.</p>
<p>It'll cost a little bit more to set up, but you don't have to worry about running out of fuel for the most part. Carefully put the wires back in the wall box.
