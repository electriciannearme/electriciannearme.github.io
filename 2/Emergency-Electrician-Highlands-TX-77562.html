A direct lightning strike is an absolutely massive discharge of electricity; a surge protector probably won't stop such a huge surge from damaging things in your home.</p>
<p>There are certain specifications for electrical outlets, especially in kitchens where microwaves and other major appliances are plugged. Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power. To remove the defective switch, disconnect the two wires from the terminals by loosening the screws in a counter-clockwise direction. Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to work on an open electrical service panel with both the door and the protective front cover removed. The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows. Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs. A circuit is comprised of multiple outlets connected to a single wire that is operated by one fuse or circuit breaker.</p>
