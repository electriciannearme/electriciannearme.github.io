<h3>How Electrical Contractors Can Give Back to the Franklin LA Community</h3>
<p>Outlets that are improperly installed can cause your circuit breaker to trip frequently. Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area. Your electrical panel box is a series of wires and breakers that dictate where power goes in your home or business and how much goes to each location. This type of wire is the foundation, or start, to all of the electrical cables I will discuss with you in this article.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
<p>Even when you shut off the main breaker, the lugs still carry live electricity. Electrical panels do more than distribute electrical power to the many different devices thru your home, they protect you against electrical shorts and circuits overloads that can cause a fire.
