The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>If it is suspected that the coil is at fault, disconnect the power from the circuit ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) and, with an ohmmeter, check the resistance of the coil, which should be very low on a DC resistance check.
