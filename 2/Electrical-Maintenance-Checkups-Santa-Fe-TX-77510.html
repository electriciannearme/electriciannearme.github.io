<p>Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is not easy. Many local governments mandate that businesses must hire a licensed electrician when doing any electrical work in commercial buildings, especially those used by the public. Keep the runs under 50 feet, and power should arrive at halogen fixtures in their sweet spot: 10.8 to 11.5 volts (for LEDs, 8 to 15 volts).

<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is.

<p>The cost of not replacing your electrical panel may be much higher if your panel starts a fire. It has a multilingual LCD display to monitor generator status, check for any maintenance, and utility power presence.

What you are describing, with both red and black wires having current at different times, but using a GFCI that carries the current for both of them, will almost certainly show up as an unbalanced current.</p>
