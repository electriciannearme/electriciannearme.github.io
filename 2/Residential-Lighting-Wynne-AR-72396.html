<p>It has some unique controls to give users an easier time, and they include LED indicators for the current generator status, the presence of the utility power supply and maintenance indicators.

Your electrician will need to know how many volts are required to power a new appliance, and if the existing panel is adequate.</p>
<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric.
