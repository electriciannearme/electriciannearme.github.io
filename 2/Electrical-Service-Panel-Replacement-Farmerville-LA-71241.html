<p>Breakers are more reliable and compliant with modern electrical codes, while also having the capacity to handle higher amperages. These features include things like automatic start, fuel gauge, alternative fuel capability, low-oil auto shut-off, noise reduction, transfer switch and wheels for mobility. Modern electrical outlets provide flexible, safe, and reliable power delivery.
