<p>Unseen, and often overwhelming, the average home has miles of wiring and cable running through it. While often used interchangeably, electrical wire and cable are different. Many surge protectors come with USB connections, so you can charge your mobile devices without having to use a their wall warts. By updating the panel and getting experienced advice on the state of your wiring, you can rest assured that your home's electrical system is safe. Since the generator is connected to your house's electrical panel, you don't need to go out and turn the switch on, connect extension cords, and connect it your home appliances.</p>
