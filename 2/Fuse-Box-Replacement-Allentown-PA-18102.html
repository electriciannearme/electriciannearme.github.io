A detailed list of local, pre-screened, Certified Electrical Contractors will be displayed for your choosing. Do not operate any electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water. The only reliable method of determining the size of the service is to observe and correctly identify the size of the incoming wires and the related equipment (mast, meter base, etc.).</p>
