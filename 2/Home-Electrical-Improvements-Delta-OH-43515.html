<p>Should I Upgrade My Electrical Panel? The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>
<p>If you're adding lights at the same time you're doing new landscaping, it can cost less for the lights. The big distinction is that residential electricians work in buildings that are residences, single-family homes and small apartment buildings.

Portable generators require the use of heavy-duty extension cords. Generators are sold by power output, as measured in watts.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't tripping the breakers right now, a 100 amp panel in a modern home is running far too close to capacity to be safe for long term use. We offer a full range of electrical services to keep your home running in top shape. Houses built or rewired more than 30 years ago may have 60- or 100-amp service (amps are a measure of the quantity of electric power). Lay the light fixtures in the approximate spots where they will be installed, and run the cable across the ground from light to light.</p>
