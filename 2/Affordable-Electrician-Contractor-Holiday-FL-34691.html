<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh).

The transfer switch automatically starts the generator, which powers the circuits in the subpanel.

Topics covered in classes can vary and might include: electronics concepts such as voltage and amperage; the science and design of pumps and mechanical motors; pneumatics and compressors; the heating and cooling cycles; and the properties of different metals, chemicals, and elastomers.</p>
