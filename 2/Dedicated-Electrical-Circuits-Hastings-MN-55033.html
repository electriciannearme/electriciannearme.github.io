<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Hastings</h2>
<p>Electrical contracting is a massive industry valued at more than $130 billion annually. My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>Repairs should never be made on live electrical circuits. The transfer switch also comes with a NEMA 3R enclosure that is suited for both indoor and outdoor installation. Though they work in different ways, they all protect the user against accidental electric shock and electrocution by acting immediately to shut off power to the appliance upon the detection of a leak” of electric current as may happen when a hair dryer falls into a sink full of water.

I have a single switch that controls the lower part of 2 separate outlets.</p>
<p>From the ceiling electrical box a receptacle outlet is fed power using a two conductor cable with ground.
