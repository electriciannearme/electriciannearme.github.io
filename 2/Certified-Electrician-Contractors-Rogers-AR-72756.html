Backup generators provide you with full-time power protection. Adding a circuit will avoid a blown breaker and electrical overload. Electrical Contractor: To qualify, you need to pass an exam, show proof of General Liability insurance and Workers Compensation insurance.</p>

<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade. If you're trying to remodel and your electrical panel is out of date, it could cause some serious problems when remodeling. Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>
<p>Before you install a low-voltage system, map out a lighting scheme to determine the amount of wire and number of fixtures you need. Rejuvenation includes new manufacturer required breakers, new connections inside your equipment, and full panel labeling so you know what each breaker does. Older homes are particularly susceptible to electrical safety dangers,” says Dwayne. Electrical Contractor License: It is local municipalities that are responsible for the licensing of electrical contractors.</p>
