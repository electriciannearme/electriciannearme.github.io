<p>It works by reducing the normally 120 volts of household current, into 12 volts and controls the time of the day that the lights are on.

The ATS prevents any back feed.” Back feed occurs when you don't turn off the power coming from the utility line and start your generator at the same time.

Replacing an old circuit breaker box merits the expense for a number of reasons.</p>
