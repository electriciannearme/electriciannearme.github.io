Landscape Lighting Low Voltage fixtures have become the norm in landscape lighting. One indication of a service that is undersized for the demands applied to it is the blowing or popping of the main fuses or breaker switch. Faulty equipment may indicate unsafe wiring.

Those tables provide the maximum power limits for a Class 2 power supply and are far too restrictive to be applied generally to all low voltage lighting installations using a Class 2 power transformer.

<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
