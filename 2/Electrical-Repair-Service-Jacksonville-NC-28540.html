The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.

<p>Likewise, if you are considering building an addition to your home or investing in some major remodeling, you will probably need to upgrade your home's electrical service panel.

And if your lights don't work, no amount of creativity or planning will save your landscape lighting design.
