A transformer is a small device that converts the high voltage power (120 V or 230 V, depending on your location) from your electric main to a lower voltage (usually 12 volts). Step and pathway lights are popular for lining walkways, and in-ground well lights add a remarkable upward glow to water or architectural features.</p>

An electrical panel upgrade requires the replacement of your existing breaker box. Before you proceed in upgrading your circuit breaker panel, you will need to obtain permission from your local building authority.
