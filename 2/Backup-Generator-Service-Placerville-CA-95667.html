Moreover, sufficient egress lighting must be installed at exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges. So no matter what size covers you need to use - tall, deep, jumbo, narrow, short - your switches will always fit the openings and screw holes on your wall plates.

This is however dependent on the size of the property and what fixtures you choose for the same. One of the most well recognized brand name among generators is Generac.
