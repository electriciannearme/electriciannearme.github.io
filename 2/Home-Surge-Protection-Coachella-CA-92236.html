<p>But, I was doing this prior to LED lighting, and the amperages were higher so it made the VD more significant than you would have with LED lighting. Our commercial electricians can provide light pole maintenance to keep your lights burning brightly (and safely) every night night after night. A generator takes energy from a fuel source and uses the principle of electromagnetic induction that was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 to turn it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>After you have determined which wire is the hot power wire, be sure to turn the electricity back off at the breaker box. Its premium power quality makes it possible to light up the house within 10 seconds of a power outage. As noted above, there are two possibilities for the incoming power: either in the switch box or in the outlet box. With factory certified technicians of many home and commercial generator brands, we can provide any necessary work your generator needs regardless of whether or not you purchased the system from us. Quality service is our priority.</p>
<p>Keep all appliance cords away from hot surfaces (toasters, range tops, ovens, etc.). Cords can be damaged by excessive heat. These 12V led lights will not get over heated or burn up like other incandescent or halogen bulb fixtures and will remain pretty cool outside ever after long hours of running since they produce a minimum amount of heat to the surroundings as well. After that, remove the screws on the light switch itself and gently pull it out of the wall.</p>
