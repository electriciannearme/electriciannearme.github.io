Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>The lighting made our property look more high end then we could have imagined. Our electricians will provide all the electricity-related services you need—and do it quickly, efficiently, and safely.

<p>Tip: If a project calls for longer lengths of wire (such as 80 or more feet from the breaker), increase the gauge size to ensure that enough electricity can pass through it. We specialize in comprehensive electrical wiring services for every aspect of your residential or commercial property. Your first step in adding backup power is deciding what you need (or want) to keep running when the electricity goes out. Our expert installers seamlessly integrate your generator into your home or business electrical network, thoroughly test your system, and stand behind your unit after the sale.</p>
<p>Electricians should also offer fuseboard upgrades to further enhance the safety of your electrics. The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
