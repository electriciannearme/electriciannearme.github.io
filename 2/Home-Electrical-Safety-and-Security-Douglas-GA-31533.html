This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
<p>Flood lights and spotlights are the most adaptable form of outdoor lighting. Wear sturdy, rubber-soled shoes when working with electrical appliances outdoors. There are two aspects to bidding a job successfully when running an electrical business: getting a healthy share of the available work and charging the right price. Helping line crews is appreciated, but working with power lines and electricity requires a high degree of training.
