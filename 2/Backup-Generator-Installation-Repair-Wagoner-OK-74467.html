Put the cable into the trenches keeping a little slack at every fixture to accommodate for light adjustment if required.</p>

Low voltage lighting wire is usable outside only. If you have a pond with an electric pump, take steps to make sure the pump doesn't electrify the water; install it according to the manufacturer's instructions and keep it well-maintained.
