<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket.

To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling. Avoid placing power cords close to electric devices that emit heat.</p>
<p>Fuses or circuit breakers of greater amperage will not correct too-small wiring or low-voltage problems, but proper circuit protection will ensure safe use of what you have. So using LEDs to light your landscape can actually help save the planet. This happens when your devices don't have any protection in place against a sudden surge in electricity.
