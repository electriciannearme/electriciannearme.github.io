To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling.

So using LEDs to light your landscape can actually help save the planet. This happens when your devices don't have any protection in place against a sudden surge in electricity.
