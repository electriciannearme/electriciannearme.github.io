At Hoffman Electrical, our team of fully certified, licensed electricians offers quality, professional, and friendly electrical service and can help you keep your home or building powered safely. Total costs vary by generator size and ease of installation, but you should expect to spend at least $3,000 and potentially up to $10,000. Any electrical work electricians perform in these areas will be tested and certified by qualified electricians.</p>
<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric. A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>
