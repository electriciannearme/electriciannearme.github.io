<p>Anytime you work with electricity, it can be very dangerous and only a qualified electrician should install this equipment. In Montgomery County, Maryland, electrical contractors need a master electrician's license before they can obtain a permit to do any work in the county.

Rejuvenation includes new manufacturer required breakers, new connections inside your equipment, and full panel labeling so you know what each breaker does.
