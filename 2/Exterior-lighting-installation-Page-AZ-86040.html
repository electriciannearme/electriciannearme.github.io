<p>Call us for an electrical panel upgrade quote or if you have specific questions regarding whether your home or business needs an upgrade. It's important to remember that the blowing of a fuse, or the tripping of a circuit breaker, is actually a built-in safety precaution for your home that disrupts electrical flow and helps to prevent overloaded wiring from causing a fire.

Another method that is not recommended is the loop, or lollipop,” which is basically a daisy chain with the wire run from the last fixture looped back to the first fixture or transformer tap.

<p>When you trip” the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them.
