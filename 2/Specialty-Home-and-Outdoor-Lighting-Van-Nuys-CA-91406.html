<p>Overheating wires can be a fire hazard and should be investigated by a 4 Service Pro electrician to identified the problem. Standby generators are great additions to any home or business. You may not be able to tell which wires feed the outlet and which go on to another outlet, but it really doesn't matter so long as the black and white wires are connected as described above. Loosen the terminal screws at each side of the switch-outlet and detach the wires from each terminal by hand.</p>
