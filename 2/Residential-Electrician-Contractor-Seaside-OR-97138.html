They are often equipped with timers and set up to light up important areas like doorways.

<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate.
