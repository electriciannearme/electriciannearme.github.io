<p>An electrical and electronic installer is responsible for testing, operating and repair of equipment and tools that make use of electronic technology. This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring.

Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors.

Every Portland home needs to be outfitted with an entire home surge protector.

Also, you can get a non-performing license that is recognized locally.
