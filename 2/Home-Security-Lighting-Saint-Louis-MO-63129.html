<p>The main benefit of a standby whole house generator installation is that they will power your house for days after a power outage. If you live in an area with frequent (more than three times a year) or lengthy (more than several hours) blackouts, then a standby generator becomes more of a necessity than a simple convenience. Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house can be stressful you need to pick the right piece since it's quite pricy. Most gardens will be amply illuminated by a maximum of 500 watts for security and 40 to 100 watts for lighting up a small area such as a doorway.</p>
