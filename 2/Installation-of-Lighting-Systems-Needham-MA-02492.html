<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later. The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>

You do get what you pay for when comes to surge protectors. Your electrical contractor, and the contractor's employees, should be licensed in the jurisdiction in which your project is located. Journeyman Electrician - You must have completed an approved apprenticeship program or you must show proof of at least 8,000 hours of practical experience or you must have worked in the electrical maintenance field for at least 20,000 hours.</p>
