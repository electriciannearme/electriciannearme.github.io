Utility companies incur significant upfront costs to start supplying utility services by purchasing power and water equipment and installing a distribution network. If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>
<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate. Most landscape lighting today is low voltage, and with good reason. As we mentioned, the older your home is, the more likely you are to need an electrical panel upgrade.</p>
