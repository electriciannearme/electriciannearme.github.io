If you have a home that's older than 30 years and all of the electrical is original to the house, this is an aspect of home maintenance that you should be aware of. Circuit breakers that are old might not have enough capacity to keep up with today's needs, or you might even have a fuse box, which is an outdated system.</p>
<p>Amatrol's Electrical Power Distribution Training System (85-MT7-B) teaches a broad range of electrical advanced manufacturing skills, such as installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting modern power distribution systems that require skills ranging from setting up basic raceways to selecting appropriate over-current protection for sensitive equipment.
