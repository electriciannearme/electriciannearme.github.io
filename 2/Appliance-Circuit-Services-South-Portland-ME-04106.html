These generators are directly connected to your electrical system, as well as an external fuel supply, such as natural gas, propane, or diesel. We begin with a list of the key components in any low-voltage wiring & control system used in a building to control lights, receptacles, motors, and equipment.</p>
<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function.
