When it's time to sell a house, having updated electrical wiring and making all repairs, if necessary, is imperative to show a potential buyer that the house is safe.</p>
<p>Article 411 was established during the 1996 National Electrical Code (NEC) cycle to provide a separate article for low-voltage lighting systems designed and listed as a complete system.
