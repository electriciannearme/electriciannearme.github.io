<p>Neutral is not needed for 240volt electric circuit, but is sometimes included on electrical device, depending on end-user application. Since the transformer is already plugged in, the fixture should light up. If it doesn't, pull apart the connector and try again, or check the lightbulb. You should consider the architecture of your house when choosing the style of the light fixture. Sharp prongs inside the connectors pierce the cable and make contact with the wires.</p>
