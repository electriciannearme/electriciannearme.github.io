Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly.
