<p>A meter base surge arrester is installed behind the electric meter to help prevent high voltage spikes and surges from entering your home and sending voltage into your large appliances. That in turn depends on the manufacturer of the panel, and the quantity and type of breakers installed. These kinds of electricians may repair motors, transformers, generators, and electronic controllers on machine tools and industrial robots. By building a rapport with an electrician, you can be sure that they will be there to help when you need their services.</p>
<p>A power outage in most households is simply an inconvenience as most people can stay in the dark for a few hours, a circuit overload, blown circuit or sparkling outlet, however, is an emergency.

Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
