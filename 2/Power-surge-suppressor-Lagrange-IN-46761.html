<p>Should I Upgrade My Electrical Panel? The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>
<p>Because of the low voltage running through the wires, there is no threat of shock. Electrician Journeyman: You need to show 4 years of experience along with 576 hours of approved training.
