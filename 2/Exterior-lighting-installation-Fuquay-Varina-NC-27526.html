The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors.

In column 5 of Table 300.5, circuits for landscape lighting, limited to not more than 30 volts, and installed with Type UF or other identified cable must be at least 6 inches deep, except for outdoor parking areas and driveways.</p>
<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light. If you notice lights dimming or flickering when a large appliance kicks on, that means they're on the same circuit and the appliance takes electrical current away from the lights when it turns on.
