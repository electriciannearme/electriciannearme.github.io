<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>Starting salaries in the electrical field can be as low as $14 an hour, but with experience or in the right position, can run as high as the high $30s. Electrical emergencies can be disruptive to your home and business. Programmable timer switches allow you to have more control over when and how your lights turn on and off. The amount would also be much lower if the homeowner does the installation, as you need not allocate an extra amount for the technician who will install the wiring.</p>
