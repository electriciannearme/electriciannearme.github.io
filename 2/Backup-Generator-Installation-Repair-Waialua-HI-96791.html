<p>We have a couple of portable generators that we can use for back-up. Obsolete electrical wiring such as knob and tube wiring does not necessarily have to be replaced (by code) but may be damaged, modified, or otherwise unsafe. If your wires are solid copper, create a loop in the end of the wire with the pliers and guide it around the screw on the side of the switch. Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>

<p>Neutral is not needed for 240volt electric circuit, but is sometimes included on electrical device, depending on end-user application. Since the transformer is already plugged in, the fixture should light up. If it doesn't, pull apart the connector and try again, or check the lightbulb.
