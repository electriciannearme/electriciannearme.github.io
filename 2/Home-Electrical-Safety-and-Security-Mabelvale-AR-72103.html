<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers. Every generator has a fuel source that it's powered by. Unless you are using a wind generator, you will most likely have to store fuel in preparation for power outages. Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
<p>A Class A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) works by detecting any loss of electrical current in a circuit (e.g., it will trip at a maximum of 6mA).
