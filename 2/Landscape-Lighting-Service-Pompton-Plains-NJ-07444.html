Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets. I keep the portable for when I do outside work at the back of our property (1+ acre) where running an extension to the house when using the electric trimmer doesn't work well due to the voltage drop.</p>

Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting design is very similar to the design of the landscape itself. There are generators that will run on diesel fuel but these will mainly be larger and for more industrial use than for the home.
