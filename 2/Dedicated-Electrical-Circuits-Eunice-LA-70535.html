<p>An electrical service panel is where the main power line from the national grid enters your home and is distributed throughout your electrical system to the lights, plugs, and appliances.

Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
