<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
<p>The Japan Electrical Manufacturers' Association (JEMA) suggests the following recommended upgrade periods by type of equipment used for high-voltage facilities based on reports from the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan and questionnaires to business operators by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
