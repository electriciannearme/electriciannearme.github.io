Code § SPS 305.40 , the electrical wiring activities that may be undertaken by a person who holds a license or registration as a licensed Residential Master Electrician, a licensed Residential Journeyman Electrician or a registered Residential Electrical Apprentice shall be limited to wiring associated with dwellings, dwelling units and detached accessory buildings and structures serving the dwellings or the dwelling units, such as garages, carports, gazebos, and swimming pools.</p>
<p>If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker.

Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
