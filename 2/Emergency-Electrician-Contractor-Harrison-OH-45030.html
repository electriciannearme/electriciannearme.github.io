Call us today for your San Diego emergency electrical service needs. Place the correct gauge of low-voltage cable into the freshly dug ditch and remember to leave it some slack. The main breaker cuts off the power to all of the home's branch circuits, but it doesn't not shut off the power coming into the panel on the utility service lines or to the lugs the lines are connected to.</p>

<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
