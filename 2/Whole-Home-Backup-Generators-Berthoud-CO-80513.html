<p>Generator Installation: Installing an emergency power generator for your home or business is a complicated process. Beauty: Having the proper outdoor lighting forms pleasing ambiance patios and decks. Even the best whole house generators involve extra costs such as fuel tank installation and set up fees, consider that generators are generally a little larger than comparable AC units, and regulations usually require that they be located x amount of feet from property lines or dwellings, and concealed by fences or shrubbery, all of which can add up. Some local regulations may also include periodic inspections.</p>
