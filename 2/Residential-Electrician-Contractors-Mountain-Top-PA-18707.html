Some dimmer switches use a resistor to dim the light and it is common for them to get warm. It does this by continuously sensing utility power and after an outage is detected, it simultaneously starts the engine and disconnects power coming from the line and energizes your home's panel through generator power.</p>

Then connect the black hot wire coming from power to the brass screw.</p>
<p>A metal oxide varistor (MOV) is thermal fused and limits voltage three to four times that of a regular current. The circuit breaker tripping is a protective response meant to prevent an electrical fire. Link Ring Smart Lights to select Alexa-enabled devices to activate lighting and adjust settings at the sound of your voice. The fixtures are arranged so that the leads can be tied together to a trunk wire leading back to the transformer. Improperly installed wiring can cause dangerous shocks as well as fires.</p>
