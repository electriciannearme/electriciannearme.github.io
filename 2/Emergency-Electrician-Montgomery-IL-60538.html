The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>Your value here goes to waste if you're not deliberate about it. Whether you create a patio, barbecue island, or a full outdoor kitchen, you have a great place for entertaining, spending time with family, or just getting some fresh air in the safety of your own home.
