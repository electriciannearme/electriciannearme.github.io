Whether it's software for customer relationship management, bookkeeping, making financial projections, tracking time, managing work orders, or job bidding, it's all out there and getting better all the time. Rather than fishing electrical cables up the wall, across the attic and back down to the receptacle, I chose the low road.</p>
<p>It closes the utility line that regularly brings power into your home and allows the generator to feed into your electrical system.

<p>Portable generators can be used anywhere.
