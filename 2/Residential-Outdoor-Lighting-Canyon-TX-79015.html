This is the amount of current that is allowed to pass through to electronic devices after the damaging currents have been diverted into the ground.

<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second.

If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire. If the surge protector worked TOO effectively, and siphoned away too much of the electric current then the appliance would not be able to work.
