<h3>LED Recessed Lighting Installation Saugerties NY 12477</h3>

To control speed and light levels without significant rewiring, however, you can use a remote switch. We understand that emergency electrical problems happen at often inconvenient times for you and your family. When most people think of power surges, the image of a thunderstorm overhead comes to mind.

Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle.
