<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician Contractor in Clarkesville</h2>
<p>QPI Electrical Company Inc. Trends like this aren't surprising, given that during Hurricane Sandy three in four people in the Connecticut, New Jersey and New York areas lost power from their utility company for at least one day, with a median of seven days of power loss, according to a survey from the Consumer Reports National Research Center People see that one house on their street that had power throughout the storm, and they want a generator,” says Dan Giampetroni, a business manager at Kohler.</p>
<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>In the case of lightning, a power surge coming in through your power lines can overheat your equipment. A burning candle left unattended or grease splattering across a hot burner on the stove are obvious fire dangers, but another major contributor to household fires is electricity. A generator, much like any tool or machine that is regularly used, will need to undergo the occasional repair from time to time. Your older home has a fuse block panel or split-bus panel, which do not have a main breaker.</p>
