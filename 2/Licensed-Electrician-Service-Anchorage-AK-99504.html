<p>You do not have to worry once there is a power outage because an immediate backup will work to supply you with the power supply that you require at home. The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed.

Also, a master electrician license is required.
