This is assuming that the feed to all the other outlets comes from the first, switched. Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground.

<p>There are certain specifications for electrical outlets, especially in kitchens where microwaves and other major appliances are plugged. Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power.
