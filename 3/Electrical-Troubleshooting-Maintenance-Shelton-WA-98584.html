So, sizing generators isn't as simple as saying, If your home has this many sq. ft., then you must get this size generator.” It's slightly more complex than that, and an experienced electrician will calculate your home's anticipated electrical loads and recommend the right size generator.</p>
<p>We bought the Generac 20kW and even though we have not needed it, it is a big insurance policy for us if something would happen that we would lose our electricity.
