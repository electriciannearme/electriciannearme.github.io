<p>120v wires must be buried 18 inches underground or placed in a protective conduit and all fixtures and connectors must be completely waterproof. Everything we do at Blue Streak Lighting Services revolves around providing the very best service to our clients. Find out if your local electrical code requires a specific light switch height. We also provide replacements and new installations. Typically low voltage lighting systems are used for landscape lighting around the home.</p>

Your Breaker is Old - If your breaker box is old and the parts required for breaker repair are no longer available, it may be time to consider an upgrade. So, if a power surge occurs, the device will keep any harmful electrical currents from damaging your home devices. Periodically check casings for damage, and replace any frayed or cracked cords immediately.</p>
<p>If your home is more than 20 years old, has constant problems with flickering lights or tripped breakers, or constant electrical failures, chances are it needs a service upgrade. If you're trying to remodel and your electrical panel is out of date, it could cause some serious problems when remodeling. Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>
<p>You should also consider the wattage of the fixtures to stay within the capacity of the transformer. When planning lighting to go around seating areas keep the deck light fixtures relatively low. Decorative fixtures will be placed in plain sight; otherwise, conceal the light source when possible. After mending the problem, the electrician can also work out the source of the problem and evaluate your electrical panel wiring to determine what needs to be done to prevent similar circumstances in the future.</p>

Now, the circuit is feeding through to the next outlet without having to have the device installed to carry the wires through. A standby generator system can protect everyone from unexpected power outages. Electrical safety inspections are one of the most important services we provide for our customers.
