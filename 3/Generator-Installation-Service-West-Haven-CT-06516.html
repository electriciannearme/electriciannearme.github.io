<p>Ask all landscape artists and architects of a great way to improve the over-all aesthetic appeal of your yard and they will all reply with outdoor lighting. If you see a white wire on the existing switch, that is not a neutral. You'll need to have the generator, transfer switch and subpanel professionally installed. There are many reasons to do so.

Other inexpensive home standby generators from different manufacturers are also being retailed here.</p>
<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG. I think that is one of the reasons why Generac came out with the 22KW unit, even though it uses the same two cylinder engine in order to pump up the NG output. Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
