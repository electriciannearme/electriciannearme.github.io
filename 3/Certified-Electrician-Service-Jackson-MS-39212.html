<p>To properly troubleshoot an electric circuit, you must know how each electrical component in the unit should function and be able to evaluate the performance of each component.

Running on the home's natural gas or LP fuel supply, it is less expensive to run than gasoline and does not need to be refilled. DO have an adult put safety caps on all unused electrical outlets.</p>
