Generally speaking, though, being an electrician doesn't come with any major risks to your long-term physical health (excluding the potential for electrical shocks, which you can read about here ). In many ways, a relatively active job like electrical work is preferable to a job that has you parked in front of a computer all day - the dangers of sitting down for long periods of time are well-documented , and this isn't something you'll have to worry about too often when you're working as an electrician, zipping from one job to the next all day long.</p>

<p>If necessary, loosen the screws a half-turn and align the switch-outlet vertically by hand, then tighten the screws. If any outlet emits a burning odor or sparks, shut down the electrical panel right away and call an electrician for help , as you could be at immediate risk for fire. If the surge protector worked TOO effectively, and siphoned away too much of the electric current then the appliance would not be able to work. For example, one circuit breaker may control the electricity to the bathroom, and one may control the outlets and lights in the living room.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting still has to be plugged into a power outlet in order to function, even though the voltage level is very low and relatively safe.
