<p>Most electric power is generated and consumed in the form of alternating current (AC), and most meters that measure energy consumption are designed to measure AC power. Upgrade the electrical wiring in your home to the latest acceptable standards if you have an older home or if your electrical needs outstrip your current demands. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. Natural disasters can wreak havoc on complex wiring systems, and it is emergencies like these where a homeowner or a business owner will need the assistance of a licensed electrician.</p>

If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
