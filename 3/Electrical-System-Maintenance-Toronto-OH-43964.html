<p>Ron Cowgill shows you how to install a regular light switch, a three way switch, a dimmer switch, a receptacle and GFCI receptacle. These fires involved equipment such as wiring, lighting, cords and plugs.

<p>Breakers are more reliable and compliant with modern electrical codes, while also having the capacity to handle higher amperages. These features include things like automatic start, fuel gauge, alternative fuel capability, low-oil auto shut-off, noise reduction, transfer switch and wheels for mobility. Modern electrical outlets provide flexible, safe, and reliable power delivery.
