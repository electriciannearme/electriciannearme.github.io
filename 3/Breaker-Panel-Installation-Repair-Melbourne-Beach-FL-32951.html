Closed doors create damaged cords. Power surges (also known as transient voltage events), are increases in voltage that are well above the normal flow of electric power.</p>
<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>

You must have at least 8,000 hours of experience over not less than four years under the supervision of a licensed electrician. The transformer is critical to your low-voltage landscape lighting.
