Similar to NM cable, UF cable is made up of three wires. That's precisely why you should keep track of how old your current circuit panel is and pay for an electrical panel replacement around the 25 year marker whenever you can. You'll now have a circuit breaker that will allow up to 20 amps of electricity to wiring that is only rated to be safe up to 15 amps.</p>
<p>We carry the latest, most up-to-date electrical equipment and tools so that our technicians can handle any electrical job.
