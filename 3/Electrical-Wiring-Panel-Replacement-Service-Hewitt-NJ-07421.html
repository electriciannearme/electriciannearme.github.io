<p>Having consistent problems with your electrical service? But when it comes to outdoor landscape lighting, 120v has some drawbacks. Finally, get licensed or certified (if required). A common mistake is to get the largest unit available to power the entire house. Many electricians consider old panels that have been manufactured by Zinsco and FPE to be very problematic.
