They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas linesâ€”that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators. Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>
<p>This will likely require removing them from the outlet and splicing the two existing black wires, along with two short additional pieces of black wire, into one wire nut.

Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>

Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>
