<h2>Low Voltage Lighting & Wiring  Bealeton Virginia</h2>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>TPC Trainco provides live training for maintenance personnel in industrial plants and large facilities. This should be handled professionally as it involves permits, building codes, and professional electrical, plumbing and potentially gas line work if your power source is natural gas. When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>
