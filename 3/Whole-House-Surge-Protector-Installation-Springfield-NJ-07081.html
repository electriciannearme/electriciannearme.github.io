<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem.

Each light point and outlet shall be identified with their circuit number and panel board number with a label pasted on them. Though each state has its own requirements, most include a certain number of years of experience and passing an examination. After removing the door or panel, you'll find the removable filter mounted under the blower motor; slide it out and check the wording on the filter's edges to see whether it should be cleaned or replaced with a new filter.</p>
