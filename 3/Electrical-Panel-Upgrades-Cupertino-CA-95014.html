<p>Lights flickering, warm to the touch receptacles, and any noticeable odor such as, the smell of burning plastic should be inspected by a licensed electrician. The power is reliably there and immediately so. Connecting lighting fixtures to low voltage is similar to connecting a garden hose nozzle to the end of a garden hose.
