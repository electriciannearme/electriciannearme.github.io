<p>2. If you need to remove the wires from the lighting fixture and reconnect it to the connector, then please insert the wires into the bottom of the jack through its center, making sure that the metal needles in the jack penetrate the wire insulation to reach the conductor. The most commos safety issue we see is when multiple circuits are installed under one fuse. During this time aluminum was a lot cheaper than copper and it conducted pretty similarly. You'll then connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.</p>

<p>Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>In that case the electrician may run a 14-2 wire (hot, neutral, ground) from the receptacle box to the switch, putting black tape on the ends of the white wire to show that BOTH wires are actually carrying current.
