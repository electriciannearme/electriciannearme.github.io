<p>In the heat of summer, many manufacturers worry about the lifeblood of their facility and manufacturing equipment - the electrical system. Landscape lighting is a great deterrent to thieves who thrive under the cover of darkness. Also, replace any frayed power cords on electrical appliances you use. Your electrical panel trips all the time. Whole House power supply can power a house up to 12,000 square feet with two 5 ton air conditioners or an electric oven and smaller home appliances.
