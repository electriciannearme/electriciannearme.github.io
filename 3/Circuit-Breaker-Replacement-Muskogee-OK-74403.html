Once a home has passed an electrical evaluation, the charging equipment can be installed. Study the service panel to learn which of the circuits control the various parts of the home.

Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>When the utility power is restored, the transfer switch automatically transfers back to utility power, shutting down and instantly resetting itself for the next power interruption with no action required by the homeowner. Turn the power back on. As you progress in replacing bigger and more complicated fixtures you may want to try installing a new fixture where one did not exist.
