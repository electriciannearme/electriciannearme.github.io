<p>A lot of us keep a generator around for those occasions where some extra power might be warranted, but a home standby generator isn't just a little piece for handling a couple of extra rooms.

<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
<p>If your home seems dark and gloomy or like it just came out of a scene from a scary movie, it might be time to consider adding some outdoor lighting.

<p>You can buy standby or portable generators depending upon the power needs for your home. The trick to replacing a three-way switch is to mark the common (or "COM") wire on the old switch before removing the wires. One of the most beautiful ways to extend your enjoyment of the landscape at your home is with outdoor lighting. The Honda cost me about $1000 and the 8500 watt generator cost me only $599 when on sale at Costco. Residents and business owners love how prepared our capable electricians are—we always show up ready to tackle any electrical problem, and always take the time to diagnose the issue entirely before diving in.</p>
<p>Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble getting your lighting to work and are unsure of what is causing the problem, give KN Electrical Contractor a call. In regard to the electricity bills and recurring operational costs to run exterior lights outside, you will get lots of additional savings benefits by using low voltage lights as these lights consume much less energy, last much longer and at the same time provide superior illumination both around the exterior landscapes and building architecture as compared to any other lighting option.</p>
