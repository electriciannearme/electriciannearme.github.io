AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>
<p>If they are hot with the top wired, but not the bottom, then you can probably wire the outlet as a half hot.

Longer maintenance intervals - We have chosen standby generators that can go for extended periods between maintenance, as compared to their portable counterparts This can save you lots of money and hassle in the long run.
