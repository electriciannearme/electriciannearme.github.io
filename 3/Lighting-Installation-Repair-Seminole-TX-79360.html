For example, experienced electricians may work with building engineers and architects to help design electrical systems for new construction. Our goal is to assist you in deciding if the backup generator installation cost is worth the benefits- keeping your home inhabitable, comfortable and safe while preventing the loss of perishable food.</p>

<p>After completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to any local or state licensing requirements. If you do not need to move the generator around and are primarily using it as a backup source, you would probably want to stick with a standby generator. An electrician's job covers many aspects of the construction of a building which includes the lighting, heating, power, air-conditioning, and refrigeration, among many other tasks that use electrical systems.</p>

We offer Design and Electrical Services with latest technology for LV & HV panels, tailor made to suit customer requirements. If you do have to use electricity outside, where it might be wet (like when you're replacing outdoor light bulbs, hanging holiday lights or trimming trees), always wear shoes that have rubber soles, and make sure you only use weatherproof extension cords deemed suitable for outdoor use.</p>
<p>Electricians are licensed for up to 5 years. Journeyman License: An applicant needs to complete a specialized training program or have 4 years of supervised working experience. If you have one or more trees that are in danger of hitting your power lines, you should arrange to get them trimmed back as soon as possible to avoid a power surge.
