Master Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC.

A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a double outlet that has one half permanently on (ready to provide electricity) while the other half can be turned on and off via an ordinary wall switch.

The number of lights is one factor, but there are others that affect the cost of landscape lighting installation, from the size of yard to obstacles in installation to the type of fixtures. We tend to use so many appliances in our day to day lives that a single power outlet is often not adequate; however, care should be taken while using double power boards or adapters.</p>
