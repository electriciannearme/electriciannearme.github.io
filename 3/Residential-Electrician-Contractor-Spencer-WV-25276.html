Any luminaire installed within 5 feet horizontally of the pool edge must be located at least 12 feet above the maximum water level of the pool. In addition, the requirements for where GFCI electrical outlet wiring must be installed have become more stringent over the years; to prevent the possibility of accidental electrocution, have a reliable electrical repair service ensure that any and all outlets located close to a source of water - both indoors and outdoors - are up to current code.</p>
