This is assuming that the feed to all the other outlets comes from the first, switched. Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground. Portable generators must be kept outside in a dry area, never inside the home or any enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces such as your basement, garage, or crawl space because of the carbon monoxide (CO) emitted while the generator is running, electrocution and fire risks.</p>
<p>Master Electrician - You must complete an approved course of 576 hours of study. Anyone who is responsible for maintaining direct current (DC) motors in an industrial facility must have a thorough understanding of the specific principles of operation, parts, and construction of DC motors.
