<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed.

<p>The aluminum stranded wiring you see on the 220 volt appliance and air conditioning circuits do not pose a problem. Backup generators work on a just in case” basis. Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need.
