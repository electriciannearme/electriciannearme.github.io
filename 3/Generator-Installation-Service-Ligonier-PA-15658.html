Also called backlighting, silhouetting is a landscape lighting technique used to dramatize an interesting shaped object.</p>

Find Landscape Lighting Transformers with a photocell or timer to effectively utilize your system. Use adequately sized extension cords when using a portable generator. Anything over this amount is considered transient and can damage electronic devices that are plugged into an outlet.</p>
