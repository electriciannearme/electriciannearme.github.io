<h2>Electrical Wiring & Panel Replacement  Palos Verdes Peninsula California</h2>
<p>The investment that you will put in to building a wind turbine generator can pay off in as short as a year or less because of the savings you will have on your current electricity bill. Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to ground‚Äù. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
