This will ensure that all of the fixtures in your lighting design are receiving adequate energy to function at their full desired brightness.</p>
<p>Surge protectors are also called power strips, surge suppressors and transient suppressors. Make sure the electrician is not only licensed but bonded and insured for the job, as well.
