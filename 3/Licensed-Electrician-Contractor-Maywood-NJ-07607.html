<p>Low speed, automotive style liquid-cooled engine runs at only 1800 rpm during a power outage for a substantially quieter generator, greater fuel efficiency, and longer engine and alternator life. Journeyman electrician license: You need to show evidence of 8,000 hours of installing electrical or heating equipment, power, light, wiring, or electrical apparatuses. The first step is an in-home consultation where an electrician listens to your needs and helps you determine the right generator for your home.</p>
<p>A generator is a back-up electrical system that operates regardless of if you are at home or away. We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office. Besides having a circuit breaker that can handle multiple electronic devices at once without overloading, upgrading your service panel has other advantages, as well.
