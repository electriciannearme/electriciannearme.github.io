But the catch is that, unlike an ordinary switch, some of these new switches require a neutral to operate correctly.</p>
<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur. It would be smart for the Licensed Electrician to take some Industrial Electrician courses too, but if time is of the essence, the electrician may want to get PLC Troubleshooting training first.
