GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water. While there are many different colors and types of materials being used within the solar lights, a flagstone pathway can be nicely illuminated with metal or copper lighting fixtures. However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace. If there is, try and add a short piece of black wire to the splice and put the other end onto the upper brass screw.</p>
<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
