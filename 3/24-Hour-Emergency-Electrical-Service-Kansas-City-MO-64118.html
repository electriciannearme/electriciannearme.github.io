A loose wire on one of the breakers; burnt contacts on the panel box, an overloaded circuit, or a worn out breaker, can cause the irregular noise. Never use extension cords under rugs or carpet, near high-traffic areas, wrapped around table or chair legs, through doorways or anywhere they can be pinched, flattened or severed. This is a new area for the Building Regulations and is called Part P (electrical safety). If you don't need to provide GFCI protection for other devices, or if the receptacle is at the end of the circuit (end-of-run), use only the LINE terminals, following the manufacturer's wiring diagram.</p>

The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
