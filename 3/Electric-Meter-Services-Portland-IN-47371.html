<p>Our home generator installation and services can provide you with some much needed electricity in the event of a blackout or even be used to supplement a solar system and abandon the grid totally. Besides the size, small profile led lights are also very good in providing your outdoor living spaces with a soft illumination that is very pleasing to your eyes at night while requiring minimum maintenance and upkeep to continue looking good for many years ahead while staying out of view during the day or appearing bulky.</p>
<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors. Utility - Lighting that fulfills this requirement is usually going to be used to light a walkway or driveway, or some other outdoor structure such as a carport or shed.</p>

I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work. The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
