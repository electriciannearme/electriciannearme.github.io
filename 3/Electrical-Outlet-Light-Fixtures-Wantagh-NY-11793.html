It allows for reasonably sized conductors (in other word the wires) to conduct electricity without significant voltage drop. This will help you avoid voltage drop, which occurs when not enough current reaches the lights at the end of a run, McGowan says. LED and other low voltage lights come in a huge variety of styles and are perfect for creating soft and elegant mood lighting.</p>
