<p>Since all your electrical power goes through the breaker panel, it's vital to ensure that the panel is working safely and efficiently. When the service panel starts to wear down, it becomes increasingly susceptible to power surges. An addition to your home or building, in the same area of your electrical meter, can be the cause for a new service location. We provide you with a comprehensive plan that will ensure that all types of electrical problems are resolved the right way, the first time, and you gain peace of mind.</p>
<p>A circuit breaker panel is not exactly the same as the fuse box because it has mechanical, toggle-switch circuit breakers, not fuses, but it does perform the same function. When you need to find a lighting repair service in your area that you can count on, remember Mr. Electric. A standby generator is viewed as an appliance that reduces the chance that you will submit an insurance claim because it can prevent damages from occurring when the power is out (like frozen pipes or basement flood damage).</p>
