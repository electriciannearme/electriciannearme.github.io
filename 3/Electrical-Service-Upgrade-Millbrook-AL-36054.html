<p>EC&M ranks the biggest electrical contracting companies of the year. Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly.
