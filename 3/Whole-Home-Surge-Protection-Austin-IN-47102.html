All of the power for your home comes through this panel from the utility company to the exit wires that split off and service different parts of the house. You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>For more information about our electrical service upgrade options, email our certified and licensed technicians today or call 908.735.6218 to request an estimate. Our electricians are skilled in all forms of electrical troubleshooting and repair, so for track lighting repair, chandelier repair, or LED light repair, you need look no further.

<p>The ground pigtail goes to the green ground screw on the switch. Ring Smart Lights can be also grouped together so that when one Ring Smart Light detects motion, it can activate an entire lighting group to illuminate a pathway or light up your entire yard.

PLEASE don't use extension cords as a substitute for repairing or installing building wiring.
