Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>

Electrical issues cause roughly one-third of all structure fires and can endanger your house, your future, and your loved ones. Greater safety - The electrical equipment in your home—wiring, outlets, etc.—is rarely taken care of properly, resulting in wires deteriorating and a greater chance of malfunctioning. Before pursuing an electrical project any further, it is important to test your home for grounded wiring.</p>
<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
