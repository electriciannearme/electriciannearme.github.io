Once a home has passed an electrical evaluation, the charging equipment can be installed. Study the service panel to learn which of the circuits control the various parts of the home. We'll show you the difference between a residential and commercial electrician, where to find a qualified electrician, what types of questions to ask your contractor, and more.</p>
