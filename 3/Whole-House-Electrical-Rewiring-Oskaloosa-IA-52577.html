This type of wire is the foundation, or start, to all of the electrical cables I will discuss with you in this article.</p>
<p>Our team at All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical is committed to making sure your home or commercial electrical system is safe and efficient for the safety of those you love.

Any damaged or frayed wiring is means for short circuiting or residential fires. Your home relies on circuit breakers to protect its electrical system from both overloaded circuits and short circuits.</p>
