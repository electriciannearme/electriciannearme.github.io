<p>The path of how to become an electrician depends on several factors, including whether the company is union or non-union, state regulations and the demand for more electricians in that region. This is assuming that the feed to all the other outlets comes from the first, switched. Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground. Portable generators must be kept outside in a dry area, never inside the home or any enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces such as your basement, garage, or crawl space because of the carbon monoxide (CO) emitted while the generator is running, electrocution and fire risks.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible.
