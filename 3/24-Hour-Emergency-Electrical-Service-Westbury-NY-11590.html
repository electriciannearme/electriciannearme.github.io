Electricians may obtain additional certifications, which demonstrate competency in areas such as solar photovoltaic, electrical generating, or lighting systems. The things that specifically change are the connections within the grid on the structure, the meter and all cables leading in and out of it, the distribution panel, which houses all the circuit breakers, and your grounding system.</p>
