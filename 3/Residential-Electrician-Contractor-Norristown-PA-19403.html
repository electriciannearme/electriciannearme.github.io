The professionals at Turn It On Electric know to shut off the power before doing any type of electrical work. The increased cost of fuel oil and all precious metals has caused many manufacturers of electrical equipment to inventory less than ever before, and in some cases, major electrical items needed for emergency electrical services and repair such as power transformers and high voltage switchgear are made-to-order with lead times between 20 and 50 weeks.</p>

Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>
