<p>An electrician refers to a person who specializes in equipment that are associated with electrical wirings of structures and buildings. Electricians must be ready to consider a wide variety of reasons why an electrical component might not be working, and that answer is not always evident.

Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home. It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as Â£10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety).
