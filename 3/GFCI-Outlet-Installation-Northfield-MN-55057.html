The first variable-speed home standby generator, the Generac Synergy varies its speed based upon electrical load, for quieter operation, improved fuel-efficiency, and exceptionally clean power output.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to a 200 AMP breaker panel, though, you can ensure that your electrical panel box is not only able to handle the power demands of your home but is also much safer.

That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>

Your home's electrical panel may have a severe problem if it's more than twenty years of age.</p>

Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
