Manufacturing and production facilities have power needs that are far different from the general needs encountered in other avenues of the electrical profession. During scheduled maintenance or on construction sites, electricians should expect to work overtime.

Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.
