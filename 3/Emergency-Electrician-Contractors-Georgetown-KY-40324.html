<p>Computers and other electronics need to be protected by a surge-protector and it can help to keep them safe and avoid any damage. Most programs provide everything you need to work in residential settings, but to become a commercial electrician or to work in a specialty area you may need additional training and licensing. Trainees preparing for journeyman electrician testing need to be familiar with national electricity codes as well as local and state electricity codes and regulations.</p>
<p>Although electrical malfunctions can be inconvenient, our professionals make the repair process as pleasant and painless as possible. And if your lights don't work, no amount of creativity or planning will save your landscape lighting design.

What you are describing, with both red and black wires having current at different times, but using a GFCI that carries the current for both of them, will almost certainly show up as an unbalanced current.</p>
