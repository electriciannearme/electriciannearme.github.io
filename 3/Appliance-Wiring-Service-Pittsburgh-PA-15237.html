<p>When doing auto electrical repair, the first vehicle component your should acquire knowledge about is the car battery. I believe the man leading the installation was Keith, and he did a terrific job to make sure the generator and the associated lines for the gas and electric outside the house were clean, neat, and actually looked good. You can buy adapters that piggyback on your existing electrical wiring to transfer data - and they're easy for homeowners to install without the assistance of an electrician. Ensure cords are in good condition - if they're worn or frayed, don't use the appliance until it's been repaired by a licensed electrician.</p>

Optical isolation uses an LED (Light Emitting Device) and a photosensitive transistor to transfer data across the isolation barrier - typically an air gap; in other words, data is transmitted using light instead of electrical signals, so there is no physical connections between the grounds and the data lines, thus removing the ground loop problems and effectively preventing electrical surges and spikes from destroying other parts of the system.</p>
