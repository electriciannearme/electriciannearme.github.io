FireGuard is an advanced device that protects your electrical circuits from arcing faults and power surges that lead to the dangers of fire. However, sometimes issues crop up at especially difficult hours, like long after or before typical business hours. You can think of voltage as a measure of electrical pressure. AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>

After removing the panel and all of the breakers, the electrician will check to ensure that all wiring is sound and grounded.</p>
<p>These can be connected to the wires in the junction box by twisting the uninsulated end of the wire from the switch to the incoming and outgoing wire using wire nuts. Low voltage lighting wire is usable outside only.
