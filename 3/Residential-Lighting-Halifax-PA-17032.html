A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit."

<p>Switch boxes and ceiling boxes can have neutral, or they can be without neutral wire. But there are a couple of things almost any homeowner can do to promote electrical safety, such as labeling circuit breakers and wiring, and replacing old outlets with GFCI ( ground-fault circuit interrupter ) outlets.
