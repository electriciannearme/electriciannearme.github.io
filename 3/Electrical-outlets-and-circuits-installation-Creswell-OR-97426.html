So, if your fixtures are each eighteen watts and you have ten of them, that is 180 watts for your transformer and 25% more for the wire.</p>
<p>A power outage in most households is simply an inconvenience as most people can stay in the dark for a few hours, a circuit overload, blown circuit or sparkling outlet, however, is an emergency.

At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules.
