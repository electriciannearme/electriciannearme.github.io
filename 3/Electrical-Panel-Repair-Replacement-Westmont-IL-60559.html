<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Westmont</h2>

There are three colors of wires in a typical single-pole toggle switch: black, white, and green. Before doing any work on the switch, the power source must be turned off by set­ting a circuit breaker to OFF or removing a fuse.

<p>Proof of general liability insurance in the minimum amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) shall be a requirement for obtaining and renewing an electrical license. An electrical panel upgrade requires the replacement of your existing breaker box. Before you proceed in upgrading your circuit breaker panel, you will need to obtain permission from your local building authority.
