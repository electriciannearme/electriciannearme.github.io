You can buy adapters that piggyback on your existing electrical wiring to transfer data - and they're easy for homeowners to install without the assistance of an electrician. Ensure cords are in good condition - if they're worn or frayed, don't use the appliance until it's been repaired by a licensed electrician.</p>

<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
