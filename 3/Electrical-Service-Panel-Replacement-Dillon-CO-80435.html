Cords and plugs that show signs of wear or damage need to be replaced. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire you're indeed playing with fire. Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>
<p>While lightning is one of the most common causes for a power surge to spike and fry your electrical devices, something as simple as turning on your vacuum could cause a power surge within your home. Our full-time, in-house journeyman electricians are fully equipped with aerial lifts, ladder vans, and bucket trucks. Outdoor light fixtures provide ambiance.
