Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>Because of the low voltage running through the wires, there is no threat of shock. Electrician Journeyman: You need to show 4 years of experience along with 576 hours of approved training.
