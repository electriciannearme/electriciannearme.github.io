To determine which size transformer you need, simply add up the wattage of all the lights in the system. Or, you can show 8,000 hours of experience from outside the state. Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one.

<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed. Being licensed means that an exam has been passed and the necessary qualifications to do the work is guaranteed. Lastly, remove the ground wire from the green screw.
