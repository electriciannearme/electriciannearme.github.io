<p>In the case of lightning, a power surge coming in through your power lines can overheat your equipment. A burning candle left unattended or grease splattering across a hot burner on the stove are obvious fire dangers, but another major contributor to household fires is electricity.

When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
