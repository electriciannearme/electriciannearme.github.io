A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).

To get the most accurate size panel for your home, we recommend having a professional electrician calculate your home's electrical load. Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them.

<p>A surge protector removes the threat of your home catching on fire because of too much power supply. Start by running the wires from the light assembly through the riser base and attach the stake. Do the same with the black wires. Even if you are not noticing any signs of failure or overload, but you know that your electrical panel is a few decades old, it may be time to replace it. On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years.
