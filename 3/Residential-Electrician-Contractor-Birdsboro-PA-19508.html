<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ".
