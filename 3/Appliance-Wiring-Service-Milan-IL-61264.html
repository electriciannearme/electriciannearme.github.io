The live feed from the distribution board connects to the terminal marked ‘common' in the double pole switch while the wire from the neutral terminal runs to the second double pole switch via a separate 3 wire cable.</p>
<p>4. Circuit breaker box. And the risk of an electrical fire will also be less of a concern since you did the right thing in scheduling a service panel upgrade. The number of lights is one factor, but there are others that affect the cost of landscape lighting installation, from the size of yard to obstacles in installation to the type of fixtures. We tend to use so many appliances in our day to day lives that a single power outlet is often not adequate; however, care should be taken while using double power boards or adapters.</p>
