These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>The screws also bore into holes on the electrical box behind them. There are dozens of low-voltage lighting fixtures and accessories available in a variety of styles, sizes, colors, and finishes.
