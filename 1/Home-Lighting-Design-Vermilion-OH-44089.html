<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>The cost of not replacing your electrical panel may be much higher if your panel starts a fire. It has a multilingual LCD display to monitor generator status, check for any maintenance, and utility power presence.

Renovation projects often include installing automated environmental controls, relocating electrical receptacles, upgrading electrical panels, and installing new lighting. Practice extension cord safety. Maglio Electric technicians install multiple outlets per room to meet your electrical needs and free you from unsightly extension cords and power strips.</p>
