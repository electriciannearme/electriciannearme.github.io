<p>Your old electrical panel box might also become a problem when you decide to sell your house. Target just the breakers that handle power for the light fixtures ( $205 at Amazon ) and switches you plan to service. Utility companies incur significant upfront costs to start supplying utility services by purchasing power and water equipment and installing a distribution network. If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>

<p>If your devices are more than 10 meters away from the installed SPD, additional protection needs to be added, such as a type 3 SPD in a nearby switchboard of a power strip with integrated surge protection. This is however dependent on the size of the property and what fixtures you choose for the same. One of the most well recognized brand name among generators is Generac.
