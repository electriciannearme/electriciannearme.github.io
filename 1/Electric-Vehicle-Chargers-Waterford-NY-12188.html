Education: Residential electricians must obtain a high school diploma, engage in an apprenticeship program, attend classes, 8,000-10,000 hours of on the job experience and the pass a competency exam to then become licensed to perform their work.</p>
<p>With a whole home generator installed by our pros at Cardinal Heating & Air Conditioning, you never have to worry about losing power. Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems. A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>

Choosing a certified, insured and licensed electrician for your electrical work is essential to ensuring the successful resolution of your electrical issues, and the safety of your home or business.</p>
