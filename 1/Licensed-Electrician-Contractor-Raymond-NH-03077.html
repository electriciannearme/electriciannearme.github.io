Before you hire an electrician , one of the first things you should do is check to make sure that the electrician you have in mind is licensed in your state to practice either commercial or residential electrical work, depending on your job.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting installation offers several benefits. Plug heat generating appliances directly into an outlet, not into a power strip or extension cord.

This may be difficult because outlet wires may be crammed into the box. The live feed from the distribution board connects to the terminal marked ‘common' in the double pole switch while the wire from the neutral terminal runs to the second double pole switch via a separate 3 wire cable.</p>
