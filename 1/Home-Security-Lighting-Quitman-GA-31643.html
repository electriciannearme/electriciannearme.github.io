<p>Circuit breakers protect the electrical circuits in your home by stopping the flow of electricity if there's an overload or other electrical fault. If you want to make sure that your lifestyle isn't interrupted because of something small like a power outage, then you might want to go with the 20,000 watt 40396.

Gasoline powered generators are the least expensive but have a relatively shorter life span and require frequent maintenance. Because all the power to your home is being restored at once, the rush of electricity can cause a surge.</p>

For this reason, it is prudent to invest in a Surge Protective Device or SPD to eliminate these potential threats and thus maximize the systems life expectancy.

Power strips let us attach several devices to the same socket, drawing more current through that socket than it is ordinarily expected to conduct.</p>
