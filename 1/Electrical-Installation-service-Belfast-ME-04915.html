<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Belfast</h2>
<p>An electrician is a tradesman who specialises in the electrical wiring of buildings and related equipment. Install ground fault circuit interrupter outlets in potentially hazardous areas such as near pools, crawl spaces, kitchens, bathrooms and unfinished basements. Electricians may obtain additional certifications, which demonstrate competency in areas such as solar photovoltaic, electrical generating, or lighting systems. The things that specifically change are the connections within the grid on the structure, the meter and all cables leading in and out of it, the distribution panel, which houses all the circuit breakers, and your grounding system.</p>
<p>Switch boxes and ceiling boxes can have neutral, or they can be without neutral wire.
