By building a rapport with an electrician, you can be sure that they will be there to help when you need their services.</p>
<p>Decide where you will plan to use landscape fixtures and the type of light you expect them to provide - uplighting, silhouetting, grazing lighting, wall washing, etc. While this is often sold to new installers as an easy-to-install method, it results in decreased efficiency (higher electrical costs due to resistance created by small-gauge cable pre-attached to the fixtures) and the drain of your transformer's power capacity. 3. Replace or repair damaged electrical cords to keep your home safe.</p>
