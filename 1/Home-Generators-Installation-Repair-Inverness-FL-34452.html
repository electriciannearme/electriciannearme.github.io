Journeyman electrician license: You need to show evidence of 8,000 hours of installing electrical or heating equipment, power, light, wiring, or electrical apparatuses. The first step is an in-home consultation where an electrician listens to your needs and helps you determine the right generator for your home.</p>

Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
