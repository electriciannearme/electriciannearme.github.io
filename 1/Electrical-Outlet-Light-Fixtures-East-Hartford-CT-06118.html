A benefit of something like an in-line coaxial surge protector, as opposed to traditional a surge protector, is that it can also store vital data concerning the power output of the specific equipment that it protects. Once they start shoving Christmas boxes into their attic and pushing them against the electrical wires, you could find yourself with a fire hazard and this isn't good.</p>

Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>
