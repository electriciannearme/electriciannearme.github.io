Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws that secure the upper and lower metal tabs of the switch-outlet at the face of the electrical box at the wall. Determine the function of the outdoor lights that you are planning to buy. Take a look at these Honeywell Automatic Home Backup Generators to provide backup power for everyday life.
