You want people driving by to take a second look because what you've created is interesting,” says Chris Mitchell of landscape lighting firm NiteLiters in Owensboro, Ky. To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling.
