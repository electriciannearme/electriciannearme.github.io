Moreover, it falls in line with light switch height ranges prescribed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Fair Housing Act (FHA) Even if your local electrical code doesn't require a specific minimum height, these acts offer guidance when installing your light switch: According to ADA guidelines, wall controls and outlets that can be reached from a forward position need to be a minimum of 15 inches and a maximum of 48 inches above the ground to be easily reached from a seated position.</p>
<p>If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
