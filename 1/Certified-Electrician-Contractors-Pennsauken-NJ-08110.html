You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet.

<p>In areas with low natural gas pressure, the Guardian Series 22 kW generator can operate on natural gas pressures of only 3.5” of water column.

This may be difficult because outlet wires may be crammed into the box.
