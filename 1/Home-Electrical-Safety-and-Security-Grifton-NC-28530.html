So, sizing generators isn't as simple as saying, If your home has this many sq. ft., then you must get this size generator.” It's slightly more complex than that, and an experienced electrician will calculate your home's anticipated electrical loads and recommend the right size generator.</p>

Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered.
