<p>With a whole home generator installed by our pros at Cardinal Heating & Air Conditioning, you never have to worry about losing power. Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage).

A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>
<p>While powering the entire house is an option, it is usually the least cost-efficient choice. Most of the time then, one usually assumes that smaller numbers equate with inadequate protection.
