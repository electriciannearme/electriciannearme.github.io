Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency. If electric fault causes too much damage, the replacement of electrical wiring is necessary. As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>
<p>But most older breaker panels can't handle anywhere close to the sum of all your home circuits. Always tape extension cords to walls or floors when necessary. Pushmatic panels have weak breaker switches that get harder to reset over time. LIGHTING DESIGN Plan your lighting design by selecting features to enhance, and areas that need light.

In the event of an unprecedented occurrence such as a severe thunderstorm or hurricane, electricity is often the first thing to go. When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
