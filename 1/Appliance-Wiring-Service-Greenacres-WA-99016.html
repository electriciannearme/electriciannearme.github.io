But none of these lights can compare to the LED light bulb. Check electrical cords to make sure they are not running across doorways or under carpets where they are can get damaged. In the safe use of electricity in the home, circuit breakers should be used to terminate power to outlets.</p>

The low-voltage electrical wiring system popularized in the United States by GE® and Remcon permits the use of less-costly and easier-to-install wiring between the relays and the switches in the home.

<p>Keep electrical appliances away from small children and use plug covers on power outlets. In addition, although building lights, receptacles, or other line-voltage devices in the building may be switched on- and off- by low voltage wiring switches and relays, those lights, receptacles, or other devices themselves may require line voltage to operate.
