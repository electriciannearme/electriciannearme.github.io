The pergola in the background is lit brightly because it's viewed from the house most of the time; however, it can be made more inviting with a dimmer switch. Journeyman Electrician: You need 4 years of experience, along with 240 hours of training. Electric cords are how we get a power supply to our appliance. Consumers should check for problems with their home electrical systems, and be ever vigilant for electrical hazards around the home and the workplace, like cracked or fraying cords, overheating cords and wall plates, and the presence of overhead and buried power lines when working outdoors.</p>
<p>Let our electricians and lighting specialists walk through your building plans and provide you with the best choices and ideas to satisfy your needs. Surge protectors are also of limited value when surges last some time and they don't protect against higher than expected currents from the power grid.

<p>If you suffer storm damage connect with a local electrician If you are using power from generators, it can be dangerous if incorrectly managed.

Enter the backup generator: your personal solution for short-term energy independence, making home life livable until your electrical service can be restored.</p>
<p>Because low voltage lighting systems operate on only 12 volts of electricity, they are completely safe for self installation. When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity. Propane and petrol generators provide a safe, longer fuel supply and are significantly more environment-friendly than gasoline fueled generators. Our outdoor lighting specialists will design and install the landscape lighting that will give you all of the above benefits and make sure that your home remains up-to-code.</p>
<p>Most standby generators are big. Electrical panels installed after 2000 are quite safe and reliable.
