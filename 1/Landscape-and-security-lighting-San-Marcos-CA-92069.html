Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>But most older breaker panels can't handle anywhere close to the sum of all your home circuits. Always tape extension cords to walls or floors when necessary.

<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
