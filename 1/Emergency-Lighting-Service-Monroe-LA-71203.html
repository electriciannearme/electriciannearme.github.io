<p>It's that you should, make sure that your computers are safely off, before you attempt to do any electrical work to your home. The electrical panel needs to replaced or upgraded if it no longer has the capacity to accommodate modern electronics and appliances. Surge protectors are more affordable than many homeowners realize, and they can save you thousands of dollars by preventing premature system failure.
