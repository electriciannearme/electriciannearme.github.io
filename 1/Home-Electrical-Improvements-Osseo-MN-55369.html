When shopping for a standby generator, it is best to go through a certified generator dealer to ensure that a generator transfer switch is properly installed by a licensed electrician prior to generator installation.</p>
<p>Consult Mr. Fix It and repair your electrical gadgets and points for safety. Check cords regularly for frays, cracks or kinks, including power tool cords, holiday lights and extension cords. Whether you are home or away, a premium standby generator will keep you running during a power outage.
