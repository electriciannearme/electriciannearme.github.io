Longer, more frequent outages and increasingly more severe storms mean that a household without power is also without many more contemporary essentials. That's why TLC offers emergency electrical services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The regular power strip appears similar but will not protect any electronic device from excess voltage.</p>

The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation adopted a new rule regarding the Electricians Program (16 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 73, §73.71).
