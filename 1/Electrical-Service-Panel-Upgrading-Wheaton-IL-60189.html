Upgrade your home panel board with our safety devices for better protection of people and electronic equipment.

Low voltage landscape lighting wire or landscape lighting cable as it is often referred as, is made of multi-strands of copper wire that are bound together.

Electrical issues cause roughly one-third of all structure fires and can endanger your house, your future, and your loved ones. Greater safety - The electrical equipment in your home—wiring, outlets, etc.—is rarely taken care of properly, resulting in wires deteriorating and a greater chance of malfunctioning. Before pursuing an electrical project any further, it is important to test your home for grounded wiring.</p>

Now, the circuit is feeding through to the next outlet without having to have the device installed to carry the wires through. A standby generator system can protect everyone from unexpected power outages. Electrical safety inspections are one of the most important services we provide for our customers.
