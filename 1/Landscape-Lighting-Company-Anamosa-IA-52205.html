<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it.

<p>At Superior Heating, Air Conditioning & Electric, Inc., we provide our customers an array of electrical services, including lighting repair and installation. Standby generators allow central Illinois homeowners access to backup power when utility services are out.

This is an essentials only” model, which can keep a few appliances and lights running but it's not going to keep your whole house lit up in the event that you lose the grid.</p>
