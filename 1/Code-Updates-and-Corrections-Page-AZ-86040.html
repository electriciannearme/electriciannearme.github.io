<p>Charging stations for electric vehicles can increase power consumption as much as 50 amps at 220 volts. After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>

Generators that have alternative fuel capability will be an even better choice as they will not limit you to just one fuel source. Being in service for over 25 years, we have learned many important aspects about electrical safety.</p>
<p>This involves determining the specific locations of each light and its outdoor power source. This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>

GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>When you trip‚Äù the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them. That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
