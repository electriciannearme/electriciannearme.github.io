<p>It is common for landscape lighting to stop working and usually a simple repair can bring yard lights back to life.

<p>Most standby generators are big. Electrical panels installed after 2000 are quite safe and reliable. On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present. Some of the new L.E.D. landscaping lights are amazing. Be careful not to overload one surge protector with equipment that uses a lot of energy; divide the load between several surge protectors.</p>
