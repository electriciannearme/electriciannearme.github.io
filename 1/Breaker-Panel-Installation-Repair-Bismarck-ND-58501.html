Ensure cords are in good condition - if they're worn or frayed, don't use the appliance until it's been repaired by a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>This course covers the basic electrical quantities of current, voltage, and capacitance that are universal to all circuits. Our licensed, certified and insured electricians are always available to help restore the safety and reliability of your electrical system. You can use your portable generator to power up your most vital appliances when your home loses electricity, for your home DIY projects, or even during a backyard BBQ. Some whole house generators come with a mounting pad or need a cement block to be placed upon.</p>

A burning candle left unattended or grease splattering across a hot burner on the stove are obvious fire dangers, but another major contributor to household fires is electricity. A generator, much like any tool or machine that is regularly used, will need to undergo the occasional repair from time to time. Your older home has a fuse block panel or split-bus panel, which do not have a main breaker.</p>
