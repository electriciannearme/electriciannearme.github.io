This suspicion could be confirmed with the use of a voltmeter With the circuit energized, after the Start button had been pushed, place the voltmeter probes at positions 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3. A no voltage reading at 1 and 2 with a voltage reading between 1 and 3 and between 2 and 3 would confirm that M2 is open.</p>

For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
