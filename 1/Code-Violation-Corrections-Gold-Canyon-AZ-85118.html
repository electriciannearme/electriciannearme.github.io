Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020. Although circuit breakers and electrical panels are safer and more reliable than fuse boxes, they are still prone to problems now and again.</p>
<p>Electricians are licensed for up to 5 years. Journeyman License: An applicant needs to complete a specialized training program or have 4 years of supervised working experience. If you have one or more trees that are in danger of hitting your power lines, you should arrange to get them trimmed back as soon as possible to avoid a power surge.

<p>If you need to buy or replace your point-of-use surge protectors, look for the UL label , or similar independent testing laboratory seal. It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
