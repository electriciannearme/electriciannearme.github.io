<p>Low-voltage replacement circuit breakers provide a cost-effective way to upgrade to current technology while increasing equipment reliability and minimizing downtime. The transformer or power supply usually has a built-in time clock to allow the system to be turned on” and off” at a preset time. So manufacturers just started to dual rate the THHN wire for both so that they didn't have to run two separate wires every time.
