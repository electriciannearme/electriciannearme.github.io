<p>One of our neighbors has a beautiful home and uses several high powered fixtures to light up the house at night.

Closed doors create damaged cords. Power surges (also known as transient voltage events), are increases in voltage that are well above the normal flow of electric power.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes. As the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to spread, Georgia Power wants to assure customers that the company has comprehensive plans and procedures to ensure a continuation of operations and service.</p>
