The main breaker cuts off the power to all of the home's branch circuits, but it doesn't not shut off the power coming into the panel on the utility service lines or to the lugs the lines are connected to.</p>
<p>If you notice any of these signs, it's wise to have an electrician come into your home and assess your breaker box and the rest of your electrical system. The electrical panel is usually set up just after the start of construction on a home.

<p>It is common for landscape lighting to stop working and usually a simple repair can bring yard lights back to life. Tracing electrical wiring in walls can be tricky, and it involves more than just looking for the wires themselves. For the most stunning effects, go with a landscape lighting specialist familiar with the various fixtures and ways to arrange them. The black wire is the "hot" wire, which carries the electricity from the breaker panel into the switch or light source.</p>
<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
