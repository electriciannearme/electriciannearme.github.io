Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below. Needless to say, a home standby generator will give you power when you need it most.</p>
<p>Circuit breakers will trip when the load reaches a certain point. In addition to LED lighting, we offer halogen and traditional incandescent lighting, as well. We specialize in artificial turf, concrete installation, driveways, landscaping, landscape maintenance, roofing, pavers, patio deck installation, construction, home additions, home remodeling, sod, grass installation, irrigation, demolition, landscapes, xeriscaping, and much more.
