Water and electricity combined are lethal so never combine them. This post is here to help you gain at least a little bit of understand about the wiring and electrical world. When you have a panel full of light switches, it can be challenging to remember which is which. Note that it is only the ‘live' wire that is connected to the switch, the ‘neutral' wire is not cut at all and the ‘earth' wire is connected to the ‘earth' terminal on the back box and on the switch if there is bare exposed metal.</p>
<p>Since it's going to cost just to have your electrician walk in the door to do any job, it is often more economical to batch together multiple electrical tasks into one larger project.
