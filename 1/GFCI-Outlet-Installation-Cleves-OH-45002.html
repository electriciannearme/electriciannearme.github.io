<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs in industry, a fuse in a circuit blows and the maintenance person gets the replacement fuse and inserts it into the fuseholder. It does add additional cost to the installation of the generator, but the peace of mind provided may be what your situation needs.

<p>If the light switch was improperly wired, it will get hot. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>
