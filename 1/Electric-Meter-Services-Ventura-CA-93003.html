The professionals at Turn It On Electric know to shut off the power before doing any type of electrical work.

<p>How much power you want in your generator depends on how many items in your home you want to run at the same time during a power outage.

These generators are directly connected to your electrical system, as well as an external fuel supply, such as natural gas, propane, or diesel. We begin with a list of the key components in any low-voltage wiring & control system used in a building to control lights, receptacles, motors, and equipment.</p>

Which is why a continual education on Electrical Safety is most essential.
