<p>The remote control makes watching television possible for those too young to realize that television watching once required getting up to change channels, but what really makes watching television possible is something else entirely. One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of.
