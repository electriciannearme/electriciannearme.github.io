This is assuming that the feed to all the other outlets comes from the first, switched. Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground. Portable generators must be kept outside in a dry area, never inside the home or any enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces such as your basement, garage, or crawl space because of the carbon monoxide (CO) emitted while the generator is running, electrocution and fire risks.</p>
