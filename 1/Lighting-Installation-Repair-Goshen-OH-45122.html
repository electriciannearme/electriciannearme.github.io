The design of your electrical system, including the placement of outlets, the type of materials used, and how the circuitry is laid out, all requires that a professional electrician does the job.</p>
<p>You can then put the old outlet off to the side and you'll be left with five wires: two black wires, two white wires, and one ground wire. The Briggs & Stratton generator is fitted with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch and computer-controlled load management power switching. A home's breaker box is central to the electrical system.
