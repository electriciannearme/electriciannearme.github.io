When the service panel starts to wear down, it becomes increasingly susceptible to power surges. An addition to your home or building, in the same area of your electrical meter, can be the cause for a new service location. We provide you with a comprehensive plan that will ensure that all types of electrical problems are resolved the right way, the first time, and you gain peace of mind.</p>
