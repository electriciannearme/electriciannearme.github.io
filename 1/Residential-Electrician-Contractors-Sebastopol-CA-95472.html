When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>
<p>Today's breaker panels are far more superior in terms of size, when compared to the standard fuse box of yesterday. Continuing with its efforts to position itself as one-stop solution provider of lifestyle electrical solutions, Orient Electric forayed into the Switchgear market.
