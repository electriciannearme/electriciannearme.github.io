Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>If you look through any surge protector reviews you will see countless types of surge protectors for every kind of appliance.

<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2.

<p>A circuit breaker trip helps to stop the flow of electricity. A good rule of thumb is that if you upgrade your panel (the electrical service into your house) you should upgrade your wiring. When the main disconnect fuses also need to be changed, along with much of the existing system, this cost can climb even higher.

The tabs held the box flush with the drywall and kept it from falling in while I screwed them into the studs.

<h3>Lightning Protection Installation for Safeguarding Your Structure in Kingston WA</h3>
<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service.
