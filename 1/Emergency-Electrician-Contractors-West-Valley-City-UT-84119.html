<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to.

Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in.

Upgrade the electrical wiring in your home to the latest acceptable standards if you have an older home or if your electrical needs outstrip your current demands. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. Natural disasters can wreak havoc on complex wiring systems, and it is emergencies like these where a homeowner or a business owner will need the assistance of a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>If you've forgotten which two black were hooked to the same timer wire you may have to play with them, changing configurations, to get what you want, but in any case it sounds like two black wires should be joined together and go to one switch terminal and the third black goes to the other switch terminal. Use power boards with in-built safety devices to avoid a power outlet overload.
