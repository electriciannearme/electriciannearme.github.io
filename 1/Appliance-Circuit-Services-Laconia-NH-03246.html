After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>

Standby generators allow central Illinois homeowners access to backup power when utility services are out. If you complete all of these tests and there is 12-volt DC power coming to the water pump motor, and it still doesn't come on, chances are the water pump is bad and it will need to be replaced. Many old electrical service panels are rated for about 60 amps, while new homes often have 200 amp panels or even higher.</p>

Our technicians can install a variety of portable generators, and we'll help you select the right one for you home, so give us a call today.</p>
