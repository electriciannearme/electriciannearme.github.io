Disconnect the other cable so boxes farther from breaker are disconnected from the circuit. Other common outdoor path lights include low profile edge, well, or flood lights. Surge protectors are an effective guard for electric devices, against spikes.

Match Trim Colors Contrasting electrical switches and outlets can be used to dramatic effect if matched to window casings, doors, moulding, banisters, and other trim. Low voltage copper electrical wire is also sold in multi-strand form for greater flexibility, and in other sizes such as 18-gauge and 16-gauge more-often used for outdoor low-voltage landscape lighting and for automotive uses.</p>
<p>A full electrical wiring inspection is the only way to know for sure where the problem originates. If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4. Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
