Electrical panels are also referred to as breaker panel, electrical service, circuit breaker panel, distribution board, or panel board. The technicians at Albritton Service Company are ready and willing to conduct breaker box repair and breaker box installation services to homes in the Ruston, LA area.</p>

Additional outlets can be powered from either that or the switch box by using the permanent hot and the neutral from either the switch box or the outlet box.</p>
