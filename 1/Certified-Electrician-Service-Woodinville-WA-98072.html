<p>Should I Upgrade My Electrical Panel? The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>

Of course, when it comes time to make any major electrical or wiring changes to your home, be sure to only have licensed and insured electricians do the work.</p>
