<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>

Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity.
