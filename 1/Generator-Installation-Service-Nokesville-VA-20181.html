Today's electronics, appliances, lighting and remodeling needs may leave your existing electrical service panel underpowered. To take a specialty journeyman electrician license test, trainees must have worked under the supervision of a licensed journeyman electrician or the appropriate specialty electrician for at approx.</p>
