Mr. Electric courteous electricians respect your property and family, providing an attention to every detail that ensures high quality, and secure work.

Many old electrical service panels are rated for about 60 amps, while new homes often have 200 amp panels or even higher.</p>

Many people are currently doing this improvement, because in the majority of homes, circuit breaker panels are usually 100 amp.
