Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>

If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>
<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable.
