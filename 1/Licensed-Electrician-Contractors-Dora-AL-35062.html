This National Electrical Safety Month (NESM), the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) is increasing public awareness of electrical hazards in both the home and in the workplace with its Be in the Know about the New” NESM consumer awareness campaign and the newly released How Do You Know?” workplace safety awareness program.</p>

<p>Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch. Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>
