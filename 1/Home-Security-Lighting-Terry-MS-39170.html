<h3>Electric Panel Upgrade Guide Terry MS 39170</h3>
<p>Quick connection points on back of outlet fail frequently with cheap electrical devices.

When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
