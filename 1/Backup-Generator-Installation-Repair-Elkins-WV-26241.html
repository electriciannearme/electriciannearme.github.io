The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows. Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs. A circuit is comprised of multiple outlets connected to a single wire that is operated by one fuse or circuit breaker.</p>
