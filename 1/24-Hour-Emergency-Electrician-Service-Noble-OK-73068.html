<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade. Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home.

The next step is to take precautions to ensure that you are as safe as possible when in your home or when working with electricity. Some of the initial system checks could include making sure that the unit controls and equipment are properly functioning. If you make the mistake of hiring an electrician who specializes in just residential electrical work or is not familiar with all the various codes and regulations, then you could be facing huge liability issues if someone gets hurt.</p>
