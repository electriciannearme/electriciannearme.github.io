<p>When you trip‚Äù the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them.
