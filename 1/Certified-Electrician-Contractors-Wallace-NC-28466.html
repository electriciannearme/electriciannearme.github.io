<h3>LED Surge Protection Wallace NC 28466</h3>
<p>Replacement circuit breakers cost $15 - $25 and an electrician will charge $50 - $100 for labor. Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians.
