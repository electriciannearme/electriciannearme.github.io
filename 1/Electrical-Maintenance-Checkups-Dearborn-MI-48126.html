<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Dearborn</h2>

So, sizing generators isn't as simple as saying, If your home has this many sq. ft., then you must get this size generator.‚Äù It's slightly more complex than that, and an experienced electrician will calculate your home's anticipated electrical loads and recommend the right size generator.</p>

Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
