<p>Computers and other electronics need to be protected by a surge-protector and it can help to keep them safe and avoid any damage. Most programs provide everything you need to work in residential settings, but to become a commercial electrician or to work in a specialty area you may need additional training and licensing. Trainees preparing for journeyman electrician testing need to be familiar with national electricity codes as well as local and state electricity codes and regulations.</p>
<p>Many states require seven years of experience as an electrician or a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering for certification as a master electrician. It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>
<p>It is uncommon to only update an electrical panel and not the entire service; however, this cost can range from $1,500 - $2,000 depending on the conditions.
