<p>Two Lutron decorator-style rocker switches and wiring (often called "Decora switches", after the trademarked Leviton switches 1 ), as installed in the United States. That's when master electrician Allen Gallant, who has wired many This Old House TV projects, takes his customers on a job-site walk-through, showing where he plans to put switches, lights, and receptacles. It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>
<p>It closes the utility line that regularly brings power into your home and allows the generator to feed into your electrical system.
