Auto electricians specialize in cars and commercial vehicles The auto electrical trade is generally more difficult than the electrical trade due to the confined spaces, engineering complexity of modern automotive electrical systems, and working conditions (often roadside breakdowns or on construction sites, mines, quarries to repair machinery etc.) Also the presence of high-current DC electricity makes injury from burns and arc-flash injury possible.</p>
<p>Low-voltage cable is commonly available in 12-, 14-, and 16-gauge.
