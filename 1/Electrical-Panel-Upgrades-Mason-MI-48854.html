<p>To determine the best whole house generator for your needs, make a list of items you would want to be powered during a blackout.

<p>This is one of the largest Generac generators available, which provides home & business owners with the best value per kilowatt available in the market today. The panel determines how much power is available for distribution from the circuits to the appliances, lights, and outlets.

Then connect the black hot wire coming from power to the brass screw.</p>
