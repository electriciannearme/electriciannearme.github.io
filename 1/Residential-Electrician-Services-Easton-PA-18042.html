There are three colors of wires in a typical single-pole toggle switch: black, white, and green. Before doing any work on the switch, the power source must be turned off by set­ting a circuit breaker to OFF or removing a fuse.

However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>And remember, if you're unsure about an electrical outlet or appliance, always ask a professional to take a look and keep you and your family safe. Older wiring was installed with lower amperage in mind compared to the requirements of today's electrical appliances.
