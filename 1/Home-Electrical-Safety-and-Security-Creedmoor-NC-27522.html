<p>In case a situation arises, like a hurricane or other type of powerful storm, you'll be glad you had Guin Service install your generator because you know the job was done correctly the first time. Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you. When installing wiring, electricians use handtools such as conduit benders, screwdrivers, pliers, knives, hacksaws, and wire strippers, as well as power tools such as drills and saws.</p>
<p>Installation is simple; just use the real metal stake to install each light into the ground in the perfect location. And if more than 15 amps flows through the circuit, the breaker trips. The transfer switch automatically starts the generator, which powers the circuits in the subpanel. In commercial and industrial settings, electrical contractors work on large projects in office buildings, schools, hospitals, as well as factories, assembly plants and distribution centers, among many others.</p>
