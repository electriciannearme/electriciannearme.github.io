<p>If you put aside the price issue, diesel powered generators are the most efficient among the various power generators mentioned. Splice the black power wire and the new black wire from the new 3-wire cable together, with a black pigtail added. Your home's electrical panel controls the electricity flowing throughout all the areas of your home.
