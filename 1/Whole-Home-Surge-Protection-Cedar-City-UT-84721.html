Inexperienced home repair contractors will often tie a new electrical fixture into an electrical box that is already at capacity.

<p>I believe that's how it was, and yes the switch works in its updated function of controlling the ceiling lights. More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps. Adding an additional fixture to a low voltage system is relatively easy, so long as there's enough power coming from the transformer to power the light. Instead, electricity flows from the transformer terminal into your house and electronics and back again by way of continuous wire paths between them.</p>
