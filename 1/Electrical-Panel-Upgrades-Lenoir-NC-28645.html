<p>Ron Cowgill shows you how to install a regular light switch, a three way switch, a dimmer switch, a receptacle and GFCI receptacle. These fires involved equipment such as wiring, lighting, cords and plugs. If you're not having any problems with your electrical system, there's a good chance that you won't need to do any modifications or repairs to it. However, if you live in an older home where someone has added a room addition or done any remodeling work, you could have problems with your electrical wiring and would never even know about it. Also called backlighting, silhouetting is a landscape lighting technique used to dramatize an interesting shaped object.</p>
