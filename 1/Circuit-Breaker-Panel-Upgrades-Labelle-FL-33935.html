<p>Having a generator is useful in a variety of capacities—especially when you need to rely on backup power or require a secondary power source. This can also happen if you mistakenly attempt to work on your electrical system without first shutting off the power. Otherwise I would have had to upgrade by service panel. Then you will use a similar item known as a Quick Connector to fasten the laid-out cable to each light fixture. And also, for your safety, throw off the master switch for the fuse box, just to be sure you don't get shocked when putting in the new one.</p>

<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
