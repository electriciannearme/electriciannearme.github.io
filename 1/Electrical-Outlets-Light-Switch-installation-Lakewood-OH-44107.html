<p>You will benefit from using residential wiring diagrams if you plan on completing electrical wiring projects in your home. Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets. I keep the portable for when I do outside work at the back of our property (1+ acre) where running an extension to the house when using the electric trimmer doesn't work well due to the voltage drop.</p>

Graduates of electrical engineering tech programs may choose to go in a direction other than an apprenticeship, such as working to create electrical designs of buildings and electronic devices alongside engineers and architects.
