<p>Installing new light fixtures involves a series of steps like turning off power to the applicable areas of your home, mounting the fixture, and ensuring that the wiring is properly connected. And to make the garden even more attractive even at night, adding lighting on it can really make all the difference. Your circuit breaker panel is truly the hub of your electrical system, and you can't get by without one. You can improve how the trees, fountains, and others look by highlighting your property.</p>

When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>
