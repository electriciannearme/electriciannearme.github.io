A generator takes energy from a fuel source and uses the principle of electromagnetic induction that was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 to turn it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
<p>IN choosing these devices, one must remember not to confuse a surge protection strip with an ordinary power strip. These whole house generators are designed to run for longer times using either liquid propane or natural gas. Just use a small electrical device like a drill and check each receptacle using the chosen device. Contact us today for a free landscape lighting consultation by completing the web form to the right.
