<h3>Low Voltage Electrical Wiring & Lighting Systems, Inspection & Repair Guide Bonner Springs KS 66012</h3>
<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire.
