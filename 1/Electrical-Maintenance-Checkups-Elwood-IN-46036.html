You would never be able to acquire any type of liability insurance as a contractor to do any kind of electrical work without a license, nor would you be able to pull a permit for a homeowner.

Which is why a continual education on Electrical Safety is most essential. If the emergency electrical situation requires electrical components that the emergency electrician does not carry in his van, SME Inc of Seattle has made arrangements with various electrical parts suppliers for emergency electrical service.</p>
