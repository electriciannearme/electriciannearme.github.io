<p>Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is not easy. Many local governments mandate that businesses must hire a licensed electrician when doing any electrical work in commercial buildings, especially those used by the public. Keep the runs under 50 feet, and power should arrive at halogen fixtures in their sweet spot: 10.8 to 11.5 volts (for LEDs, 8 to 15 volts). Below: this is a sample of plastic-insulated multi-strand electrical wire that was encased in the rubber jacket shown above.</p>
<p>The same can be said if you do have a modern circuit breaker box, but find that you have to reset your circuit breakers too often. The hot wire and the switched wire are connected with that tab, making both wires hot all the time, whether in that outlet or another on the same switch. Creative lighting can produce dramatic effects that show off the beauty of your home and accentuate the landscape.
